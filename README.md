  ## Installation
  
  Steps required to install this project and how to get the content management system running: To generate your CMS first run npm install in order to install the following npm package dependencies as specified in the package.json: 
  * Use the [MySQL](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql) NPM package to connect to your MySQL database and perform queries.

  * Use [InquirerJs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/0.2.3) NPM package to interact with the user via the command-line.
  * Use [ASCII-art Logo](https://www.npmjs.com/package/asciiart-logo/v/0.2.3) NPM package to interact with the user via the command-line.

  * Use [cons ole.table](https://www.npmjs.com/package/console.table) to print MySQL rows to the console. There is a built-in version of `console.table`, but the NPM package formats the data a little better for our purposes.
